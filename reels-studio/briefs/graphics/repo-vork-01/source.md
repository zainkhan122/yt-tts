## voyager-so-vork.md

vork, the Voyager rendering kernel, is a headless 3D and VFX engine built for agents.



Watch the film: a car drives into the night as the forest
turns into glowing cyan wireframe, drawn from real triangle edges by a scene shader.

brighter head and tail lights, wheel pose. Trees, ground and asphalt from Poly Haven
(CC0). The far mountains and sky are an image-model painting on a curved 3D card;
everything else that moves is rendered.

## Paste this to your agent

Install vork, then paste:

> Read `vork help`. Make a small scene, render a preview and inspect the image.
> Refine the camera and lighting before rendering at final quality. Read the
> relevant help topic when you need a feature the first page doesn't explain.

A million birds, each steering itself over a lagoon. A black hole that bends
light. A glowing seed placed on a real desk, lighting the room around it.
These are scenes written as code and rendered on a GPU. No video model required.

vork is written in Rust and Slang, with GPU rendering through Vulkan and Metal.
An agent writes a scene,
renders it, looks at the result and revises the code. There is no editor to drive.

Most creative tools expose controls that a person can operate. An agent can also
write a shader in the middle of a shot. vork gives it geometry, ray queries and
GPU execution, then lets scene programs define materials, cameras, light
propagation, simulation and compositing. Ordinary shots need only scene data;
the programming hooks are there when the shot needs something unusual.

Source-available and free during the research preview.

## What you can make

The examples include code, preparation commands and credits. Large downloaded
assets and footage stay outside Git; the recipes fetch them or accept a local path.
The images here are stills from these shots. Keep each credit with its image.

### Million birds

A million simulated agents steered by Slang compute programs, with a camera skimming
through the flock. The camera and nine foreground birds are authored; the simulated
million do not flap. The bird stills above come from the measured four-sample,
denoised skim and reveal movies.

Changes: sampled flight pose, reduced distant mesh, rescaled, articulated flight
wings, extracted wings for the starling body, resized textures.

### Black hole

The scene supplies a Schwarzschild light-propagation program through vork's public
hook. Curved paths, capture and the disk's appearance live in the example. It is a
numerical approximation, not an exact relativistic solver.

Changes: decimated geometry, resized, compressed and exposure-adjusted textures,
adjusted material roughness and metallic weight, placement and scale.

### Water

A GPU liquid simulation implemented as Slang compute programs in vork's fluid library.
It uses published APIC/FLIP and surface-reconstruction methods, with an authored
initial impulse and limited secondary spray.

## Give it to an agent

Start with `vork help`. The getting-started help is about **2,500 tokens**,
including a complete first scene. Root, topic and command help total about
**19,500 tokens**; detailed field lookups add more. These are release 0.1.0
counts with the o200k_base tokenizer, not a measure of the whole API. The aggregate
concatenates `vork help`, each listed topic except `field` with `--all`, and `--help` for
render/std/setup/help. `vork help field material.inputs` includes another 38
lookup-only records (about 1,800 tokens).

Use the prompt above to start.

Python and TypeScript can author ordinary scene JSON through the SDKs. You can
also write JSON directly. Save this as `shot.json` (also available as
examples/first-scene.json):

```json
{"version":2,"nodes":[
  {"type":"mesh","geometry":{"std":"sphere","radius":1},
   "materials":[{"inputs":{"base_color":[0.12,0.35,0.65],"specular_roughness":0.3}}]},
  {"type":"mesh","translation":[0,-1,0],"geometry":{"std":"grid","size":[10,10]},
   "materials":[{"inputs":{"base_color":[0.35,0.35,0.35]}}]},
  {"type":"light","shape":"rectangle","translation":[-3,5,4],"target":[0,0,0],
   "energy":700,"size":4,"color":[1,0.92,0.8]},
  {"type":"camera","translation":[3,2,5],"target":[0,0,0]}
],"render":{"resolution":[640,480]}}
```

```sh
vork render shot.json --profile std/previs --out preview.png
vork render shot.json --profile std/final --out final.png
vork help sdk
vork help programs --all
```

Scene content and render quality are separate. Use `std/previs` to iterate,
`std/draft` for scene-ray lighting at 4 samples,
`std/final` for the default delivery profile, and `std/path` for path transport.
Final approximates indirect lighting and can darken interiors, including glossy
bounces. More samples do not restore omitted transport; try path and inspect.
Draft and final use 4 and 8 samples with bundled OIDN denoising by default; use `--set denoise=false` to turn it
off. `--set samples=N` overrides the profile budget (1..4096); more samples means cleaner and slower.
Without a fast GPU denoiser (NVIDIA or Apple GPU), draft and final say so and use 16 and 32 samples undenoised;
`--set denoise=true` runs the slow CPU denoiser anyway.
For a particular field, ask `vork help field node.target`. Help topics include
exact fields with `--all`. Images, video and control passes come from the same
scene; see `vork help outputs`.

## Under the hood

Default rendering combines raster visibility with hardware ray-traced lighting;
a path tracer is also available. The scene and render plan stay installed.
Frames use retained GPU resources, with GPU-to-hardware-video encoding on
supported native paths. A portable encoding fallback reads pixels back to the CPU.

Slang programs run on the GPU. Host parsing, planning, animation-track evaluation
and IO still use the CPU. The public program hooks let a scene author change
camera rays, material response, light propagation and film response without
editing the renderer. `vork help programs --all` describes their scope.

Validation includes furnace tests and analytic oracles, alongside render tests.
That is a way to catch errors, not a guarantee that every scene is physically
exact.

## Speed, with the qualifications

These are timings, **not equal-quality speedups**. The draft/final results
come from the frozen `81ae2b075` build on an NVIDIA L4: final uses eight samples
and OIDN, draft four and OIDN. All 152 planned jobs were accounted for. The broader
sweep delivered 583 of 585 images; the million-stars stress scene ran out of GPU
memory in both profiles. Visual review found softer edges, grainier defocus,
wall mottling and changed sparse or spectral highlights at these budgets.
Nineteen earlier quality comparisons failed their declared no-worse FLIP
condition; that experiment was not repeated for this build.

vork times below are complete command wall times, including startup, scene
loading, output writes and encoding. Setup, shader warmup, provisioning and
transfers are excluded. Stills use five warm repetitions, movies three. Driver
caches and clocks were not controlled. Blender 5.2.1 times are retained measured
baselines, not fresh runs: EEVEE uses different settings, and its movie times
exclude startup/loading after a still prime. Both movie timings include encoding.
The car is a proxy. Benchmark method and recorded results
explain the boundaries and carried-forward numbers.

### Default final: stills

1080p PNG, seconds. EEVEE uses 64 samples without denoising; vork uses eight with
OIDN. Missing Blender results are unmeasured, not wins.

| Scene input | EEVEE (s) | vork final (s) | Comparison |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| B-push-in.json | 2.912 | 1.993 | 1.46× faster |
| B-turntable.json | 3.148 | 2.247 | 1.40× faster |
| B-walking.json | 2.612 | 1.890 | 1.38× faster |
| B-interior.json | 2.892 | 1.738 | 1.66× faster |
| B-street.json | unmeasured | 2.043 | unmeasured |
| B-rack-focus.json | unmeasured | 1.787 | unmeasured |
| B-car-pan.json | 2.458 | 1.691 | 1.45× faster |
| B-crowd.json | unmeasured | 2.046 | unmeasured |
| B-night.json | 2.963 | 1.937 | 1.53× faster |

### Default final: complete movies

240 frames, 1920×1080, 24 fps. These four public B-scene clips are part of the
seven-scene comparison; the full seven measured 1.14–2.32× against EEVEE.
Different quality and timing boundaries still apply.

| Scene input | EEVEE (s) | vork final (s) | Comparison |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| B-blocking.json | 88.072 | 47.082 | 1.87× faster |
| B-interior.json | 107.026 | 59.231 | 1.81× faster |
| B-car-pan.json | 93.489 | 81.740 | 1.14× faster |
| B-night.json | 213.477 | 92.201 | 2.32× faster |

### Path tracing: carried-forward measurements

These 1080p still timings were measured in an earlier freeze, not on that
build. Adaptive sampling up to 4,096, threshold 0.01, minimum 64; stopping
implementations differ. vork is slower in both cases below.

| Scene input | Cycles (s) | vork path (s) | Comparison |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| B-car-pan.json | 4.632 | 26.901 | 5.81× slower |
| B-night.json | 16.041 | 31.860 | 1.99× slower |

### Setup and first use

On B-blocking.json, the final-profile setup took
250.792 s, the first still after setup 2.298 s, and the warm median 2.094 s.
The retained EEVEE cold still was 20.633 s and warm median 2.405 s. Other scenes
can still spend substantial time compiling new programs after setup: rack-focus's
first final still took 82.057 s, versus its 1.787 s warm median.

### Previews: carried-forward measurements

These are prior-freeze `std/previs` results, not measured on `81ae2b075`. Previews
use different lighting and shadows; these are not final-quality comparisons.
Complete 240-frame, 1080p24 movies, median of three warm commands:

| Scene input | Preview movie (s) |
|---|---:|
| B-blocking.json | 3.496 |
| B-interior.json | 4.565 |
| B-car-pan.json | 6.391 |
| B-night.json | 5.864 |
| B-crowd.json | 4.097 |
| B-push-in.json | 3.705 |
| B-rack-focus.json | 3.902 |
| B-street.json | 3.964 |
| B-turntable.json | 4.612 |
| B-walking.json | 2.190 |

Across the seven simple preview clips in that prior freeze, EEVEE/vork was
14.63–36.40× and Workbench/vork 3.99–11.24×. Those ranges use retained Blender
baselines and different rendering settings and timing boundaries. They do not
describe default final rendering.

### Million birds: measured movies, projected Blender times

The bird inputs include the compute programs and
all three cameras. These `std/draft` movies use four samples and OIDN at
1080p24; each number is the median of three full commands. The first full movie
is included in that three-command median, after a separate 320×180 still warmup.
Setup and warmup are excluded from the movie times below. For skim, setup +
warmup + the movie median total 506.781 seconds (8.45 minutes); asset preparation
and transfers are additional.

| Camera input | Frames | vork movie (s) | Setup (s) | Warmup (s) | EEVEE 16-sample projection (s), both retained runs |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| skim.json.in | 192 | 96.942 | 243.809 | 166.030 | 1511.108 / 1817.625 |
| dive.json.in | 240 | 124.718 | 167.376 | 112.994 | 2517.891 / 2417.831 |
| reveal.json.in | 288 | 153.411 | 163.218 | 113.910 | 2916.237 / 2889.758 |

The EEVEE values extrapolate eight warm frames; they are **projections, not
measured movies**. They omit simulation, startup and video encoding, and receive
the finished flock as geometry. They use **16 samples** against vork's four, so this
table is not a like-for-like speed comparison.

The matching four-sample EEVEE projection exists only for skim: 773.7–1,082.5 s
across the retained runs, with ray tracing on or off, about 8–11× the 96.9 s vork
movie. Dive and reveal have no four-sample EEVEE projection. Quality, material
translation and motion differ.

### Rerun

```sh
python3 benchmarks/fetch.py
python3 benchmarks/run.py --vork vork --out /tmp/vork-benchmark
python3 integrations/blender/benchmark.py --blender blender --out /tmp/blender-benchmark
```

The vork runner measures undenoised B-scene variants, not the denoised final8
tables above. It omits draft and does not set the recorded seed 11. The bird
runner uses previs/final with a full-resolution warmup, not the recorded draft4
workflow. The final8/draft4 tables use build `81ae2b075`; preview and path results
come from earlier freezes, as noted beside those tables.

The Blender helper currently fails during camera preparation on Blender 5.2.1.
Independent reproduction of the comparisons is not working. The commands above
are supplied for inspection; see the method.

## Research-preview limits

Fog and participating volumes are ignored with warnings in this release. Large scenes
and dense transparency can fail, including on Mac; reducing image resolution
alone does not necessarily fix them. Some heavy interiors work with `std/path`
when the default hybrid profile fails. First use of a new program can involve
substantial compilation, even after `vork setup`.

At four/eight samples, fine facades and hair can lose detail, defocus can show
stepped or grainy edges, and sparse sparks or spectral highlights can change
brightness and colour. Try `--set samples=32` for these shots; more samples cost
more time. The frozen sweep retained a million-stars allocation failure in both
profiles. Mac reliability was not revalidated in that Linux run.

The water quickstart is a closed-shutter diagnostic. The full motion-blurred
scene is much more expensive. It is a uniform-grid experiment with finite particle budgets,
unresolved thin features and no two-way rigid-body coupling. It is not a general
replacement for a mature simulation package. The VFX camera solve and single-view
relief are estimates, with limitations documented beside the example.

The next direction is fog and volumes, broader simulation, and better reliability
and performance on demanding scenes. There is no release date promised for those
features. Read `vork help limits` before committing to a shot.

## Install

Binary packages are available from GitHub Releases
once a release is published. Keep the entire install folder together: Slang, OIDN,
libraries, examples, SDKs and licence texts are runtime companions to the binary.

- **Linux:** x64, glibc 2.35+ and libstdc++ with `GLIBCXX_3.4.30` (Ubuntu 22.04+), a recent NVIDIA GPU and its hardware-ray-tracing Vulkan driver.
- **Windows:** x64 Windows 10/11, a recent NVIDIA GPU and its hardware-ray-tracing Vulkan driver.
- **Mac:** Apple Silicon with Metal, macOS 26 for the bundled Slang toolchain. Older macOS versions are unqualified. Intel Macs are unsupported. H.264 uses system VideoToolbox.

### Linux

Install the NVIDIA driver for your GPU first. On Ubuntu 22.04+:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl tar libvulkan1 libgomp1 ffmpeg
curl -fL  -o /tmp/vork-install.sh
sh /tmp/vork-install.sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
vork --version
vork help
```

These dependency commands are for Ubuntu with sudo. In a root container, omit
`sudo`; without administrator access, arrange for the dependencies to be installed.
The installer itself runs in your user account without root.

The installer verifies SHA256SUMS, installs under `$HOME/.local/lib/vork`, links
`$HOME/.local/bin/vork`, runs `vork setup`, and adds the PATH line to your shell's
startup files, including the one login shells read. The `export` above covers the
current shell, and any shell that reads no startup file, such as plain `bash -c`.
`VORK_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1` or a custom `PREFIX` leaves startup files alone. Linux MP4 needs ffmpeg even when NVENC encodes frames, because ffmpeg
muxes the stream. Native NVENC is attempted on NVIDIA; otherwise encoding uses a
readback fallback. Older GPUs and software Vulkan adapters are unsupported.
A100, H100, H200, B200 and B300 lack the required hardware ray tracing; recency
alone does not make a NVIDIA GPU suitable. Containers also need working NVIDIA
Vulkan driver discovery; passing through a GPU alone may not be sufficient.

### Mac

The released 0.1.0 archive has these Mach-O `LC_BUILD_VERSION` minimums:

| Binary | macOS minimum |
|---|---:|
| `vork` | 11.0 |
| `slang/bin/slangc` | 26.0 |
| `slang/lib/libslang-compiler.0.2026.20.dylib` | 26.0 |
| `slang/lib/libslang-glsl-module-2026.20.dylib` | 26.0 |
| `oidn/lib/libOpenImageDenoise.2.5.1.dylib` | 11.0 |
| `oidn/lib/libOpenImageDenoise_core.2.5.1.dylib` | 11.0 |
| `oidn/lib/libOpenImageDenoise_device_cpu.2.5.1.dylib` | 11.0 |
| `oidn/lib/libOpenImageDenoise_device_metal.2.5.1.dylib` | 11.0 |
| `oidn/lib/libtbb.12.19.dylib` | 11.0 |

These are archive load-command targets, not tests on older macOS versions.
A successful `vork --version` does not test Slang; new authored programs need it.

In Terminal:

```sh
curl -fL  -o /tmp/vork-install.sh
sh /tmp/vork-install.sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
vork --version
vork help
```

The same installer verifies and installs the complete Apple Silicon archive under
`$HOME/.local/lib/vork`, runs setup, and adds the PATH line to your shell's startup
files (`.zshenv` for zsh). Mac packages are signed with Apple Developer ID and notarised.

MP4 uses VideoToolbox without ffmpeg. Install ffmpeg only for video decoding or
encoding fallbacks, including MOV/ProRes fallback (`brew install ffmpeg`).

### Windows

Install the NVIDIA driver for your GPU and ffmpeg (`winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`).
Without winget (including Windows Server 2022), download `ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip` from
Gyan, extract it, and add its `bin` folder
to your user PATH.
Open a new PowerShell window so ffmpeg is on PATH, then:

```powershell
$installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'vork-install.ps1'
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing  -OutFile $installer
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $installer
$env:Path = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\vork;$env:Path"
vork --version
vork help
```

These dependency commands are for Ubuntu with sudo. In a root container, omit
`sudo`; without administrator access, arrange for the dependencies to be installed.
The installer itself runs in your user account without root.

The installer verifies SHA256SUMS, installs under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\vork`,
runs `vork setup`, and adds that folder to your user PATH so new windows find `vork`;
the `$env:Path` line above covers the current one. `VORK_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1` or a custom
`PREFIX` leaves it alone.
Windows MP4/MOV needs ffmpeg; MP4 uses its NVENC encoder when compatible, otherwise
libx264. FFmpeg 9.0.2 requires NVENC API 13.1 (NVIDIA driver 610+) for
hardware encoding; older drivers fall back to libx264. The cache is under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\vork`.

### Manual archive install (Windows)

Download the Windows `.zip` and `SHA256SUMS` from the release page. Compare
`Get-FileHash .\vork-*-windows-x64.zip -Algorithm SHA256` with its entry in
`SHA256SUMS`, then unzip the entire contents into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\vork`.
Add that folder to your user PATH, open a new PowerShell window, and run
`vork setup`. It prints its report right away, then compiles for up to about 3 minutes
with no output until `Shader setup completed`; that isn't a hang. Keep all bundled
runtime companions beside the executable.

The separately downloadable `install.sh` downloads the release from GitHub; to install an archive you already
have without downloading again, use the manual steps below.

### Manual archive install (Linux or Mac)

Download your platform's `.tar.gz` and `SHA256SUMS` from the release page into a
new empty folder. In that folder, verify and install the entire archive:

```sh
set -- vork-*.tar.gz
test "$#" -eq 1 || exit 1
archive=$1
awk -v name="$archive" '$2 == name || $2 == "*" name' SHA256SUMS > selected.sha256
test "$(wc -l /dev/null 2>&1; then
  sha256sum -c selected.sha256 || exit 1
else
  shasum -a 256 -c selected.sha256 || exit 1
fi
PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
mkdir tree
tar -xzf "$archive" -C tree
mkdir -p "$PREFIX/bin" "$PREFIX/lib/vork"
cp -R tree/. "$PREFIX/lib/vork/"
ln -sf "$PREFIX/lib/vork/vork" "$PREFIX/bin/vork"
export PATH="$PREFIX/bin:$PATH"
vork --version
vork setup
```

`vork setup` prints its report right away, then compiles for up to about 3 minutes
with no output until `Shader setup completed`; that isn't a hang.

### First render and SDKs

Save the first scene above as `shot.json`, then:

```sh
vork render shot.json --profile std/previs --out preview.png
vork render shot.json --profile std/final --out final.png
vork render shot.json --profile std/final --frame-start 0 --frame-end 47 --out clip.mp4
vork help animation
vork help outputs
```

The first render of a scene with new programs can compile for several minutes and
prints nothing while it does (about 3–4 minutes with custom programs on NVIDIA in our
tests, under 20 seconds on a Mac). It isn't hung, so don't kill it or give it a short
timeout. Later renders of the same programs take seconds.

Frame ranges include both endpoints: `0` through `47` writes 48 frames. The simple scene
is static; animation tracks make a moving clip. To try glTF import, save a model
as `model.glb` beside this scene as `model.json`:

```json
{"version":2,"nodes":[
  {"type":"asset","file":"model.glb"},
  {"type":"light","shape":"rectangle","translation":[-3,5,4],"target":[0,0,0],"energy":700,"size":4},
  {"type":"camera","translation":[3,2,5],"target":[0,0,0]}
],"render":{"resolution":[640,480]}}
```

```sh
vork render model.json --profile std/final --out model.png
```

Adjust the camera and light for your model's scale. glTF files can refer to
textures and buffers beside them; keep those files together.

Run `vork setup` again after upgrading or changing GPU drivers. It prints its report
right away, then compiles for up to about 3 minutes with no output until
`Shader setup completed`; that isn't a hang. Vulkan persists
its pipeline cache when supported; Metal warms the system driver cache. New scene
programs can still require compilation on their first render. `VORK_CACHE_DIR`
overrides the cache location.

The archive includes Python 3.11+ and TypeScript SDK source/packages. Install the
Python SDK into your authoring virtual environment, and the TypeScript SDK into
your project (Node 22.18+ and npm):

```sh
python3 -m pip install "$HOME/.local/lib/vork/python"
npm install "$HOME/.local/lib/vork/sdk"
```

The SDKs install from your vork folder, not from npm or PyPI. The npm package named
`vork` is unrelated, and the PyPI package only points back here.

On Windows use `py -m pip install "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\vork\python"` and
`npm install "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\vork\sdk"`. Import as `vork` in Python or
`@usevoyager/vork` in TypeScript; keep the native executable on PATH.
For source builds, see `vork help build`.
